## Querying Microsoft Documentation

You have access to MCP tools called `microsoft_docs_search`, `microsoft_docs_fetch`, and `microsoft_code_sample_search` - these tools allow you to search through and fetch Microsoft's latest official documentation and code samples, and that information might be more detailed or newer than what's in your training data set.

When handling questions around how to work with native Microsoft technologies, such as C#, F#, ASP.NET Core, Microsoft.Extensions, NuGet, Entity Framework, the `dotnet` runtime - please use these tools for research purposes when dealing with specific / narrowly defined questions that may occur.
